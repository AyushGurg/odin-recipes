        <li>1 tsp curry powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 tsp clear honey</li>
        <li>2 skinless breast fillets</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sweet chili sauce</li>
        <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>

    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour the tamari into a large dish and stir in the curry powder, cumin, garlic and honey. Mix well. Slice the chicken breasts in half horizontally to make 4 fillets in total, then add to the marinade and mix well to coat. Set aside in the fridge for at least 1 hr, or overnight, to allow the flavours to penetrate the chicken.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix the peanut butter with the chilli sauce, lime juice, and 1 tbsp water to make a spoonable sauce. When ready to cook the chicken, wipe a large non-stick frying pan with a little oil. Add the chicken and cook, covered with a lid, for 5-6 mins on a medium heat, turning the fillets over for the last min, until cooked but still moist. Set aside, covered, to rest for a few mins.</li>
        <li>While the chicken rests, toss the lettuce wedges with the cucumber, shallot, coriander and pomegranate, and pile onto plates. Spoon over a little sauce. Slice the chicken, pile on top of the salad and spoon over the remaining sauce. Eat while the chicken is still warm.</li>
    </ol>
